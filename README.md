This repository contains datasets and notebook used in our paper "Introducing a Family of Synthetic Datasets for Research on Bias in Machine Learning". 

## Abstract
A significant impediment to progress in research on bias in machine learning (ML)is the availability of relevant datasets. This situation is unlikely to change muchgiven the sensitivity of such data. For this reason there is a role for synthetic datain this research. In this short paper we present one such family of synthetic datasets.  We provide an overview of the data, describe how the level of bias can bevaried and present a simple example of an experiment on the data.
